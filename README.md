# SkillReg

SkillReg builds the infrastructure to make the skills-driven agent world possible. 

This is the definition of a skill:

```
# skill.json

{
  "name": "Skill Name",
  "description": "Brief description of the skill.",
  "runtime_required": ["Python"],
  "input_format": "Expected input format or structure of the skill.",
  "output_format": "Expected output format or structure generated by the skill.",
  "env_required": ["SOME_API_KEY", "ANOTHER_API_KEY"],
  "documentation": "Additional documentation or references for the skill."
}

```

The code must be written in skill.* where * is the file extension for your runtime. For example:

```
# skill.py

def skill_code(argument_1):
    5 * 2

```

Make sure to include the related requirements, whether it's a `requirements.txt` or a `package.json`

```
# requirements.txt
